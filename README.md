# RevenueManagement
Revenue Management includes 4 core domain : -> Pricing ,Optimization based on performance, prediction, customers or actual .
This final project for SDA covers customers and pricing part of it (this project can be improved with data science libraries like matplotlib etc to predict and optimize better)
for now scope is a basic UI with view pages of revenue , costs and gross margin that can be queried over the asked period it will have in scope and whats the final status looks like at the end of queried period for this assumed mock company
Accounting not taken into consideration for now and basic movements are not dual entry.
This compant gets money from customer as revenue , than breaks down this revenue as per pricing to calculate cogs/costs of goods - 30% of fees , rest 70% is Gross Margin


Key wordings in the project :
Revenue = money received from customer as fees (This is different from income , a compant may have income but part of it only can be revenue to the company)
COGS = cost of goods
Gross Margin  = Revenue - cogs  - This is a KPI for many firm or GM% also is a KPI measured across finance industries.
Revenue page for this mock company will list all accounts that receive fees from customers that this company charges it customers
Cogs page will give list all accounts at the period that shows incurred costs 
GM is presented along with Revenue and cogs in PnL page.
